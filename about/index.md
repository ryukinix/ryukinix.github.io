## About Me
I have a deep passion for Mathematics and the sciences that build upon it. While I believe all knowledge is valuable, I'm most captivated by the intersection of mathematics and computer science. You can find my resume [here](https://resume.lerax.me).

## Programming Languages

I enjoy programming in several languages, with a preference for
Python, Lisp, and C. I also have experience with Haskell, Rust, Go,
and F#. While I'm familiar with C++, Java, and C#, I don't use them as
frequently.

## Current Life

I began my Computer Engineering studies in 2014 at the Federal University of Pará (UFPA) and transferred to the Federal University of Ceará (UFC) in 2016. I graduated from UFC in 2024. Since 2023, I have been pursuing my master's degree at ITA, with a focus on machine learning. My research in this area builds upon projects like [EGSIS](https://github.com/ryukinix/egsis), where I explored graph-based algorithms for semi-supervised image segmentation.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the connections between pure Mathematics, applied Computer Science, and Music. For example, I find the idea of using mathematical and computer engineering techniques to synthesize music to be fascinating.


## The Nicknames: Ryukinix and Lerax

**Ryukinix** comes from 2009; it was the name of my archer character in the Ragnarok private server *Odin-br*. I was looking for an original name, and it just came to me. No special reason, but those were good times.

**Lerax** comes from 2013; it was a random name I chose for my character in WarFace, an FPS game built on the CryEngine.

Since then, I've used both nicknames in different situations.
