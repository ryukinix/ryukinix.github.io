## Tag of life
I love Mathematics - then the subsequent science falls like a glove
upon that passion. All knowledge is valid, but IT is the merger that
captivates me more. You can find me resume here: https://resume.lerax.me

## Programming Languages

In general I like programming mostly in Python, Lisp and C. Sometimes
I try to code in other languages like Haskell, Rust, Go and F#.
Although I know about C++, Java and C, I do not use these languages
everyday. In general my knowledge about programming languages ranked
in five stars scale as maximum confidence and interest as well knowledge are
sorted as:

## Current life

Manoel Vilela Machado Neto is a student of Computer Engineering
since 2014. Started on the Federal University of Pará (UFPA) and
migrated to Federal University of Ceará (UFC) in 2016, which currently
studies. He have interests mainly in the area of computational
intelligence and operating systems. The main topics focused currently
is inside of Natural Language Processing (2015) as well a recent interest was
discovered in Digital Signal Processing (2017).

As my hobbies, I have a lot of interests in the way that the
pure Mathematics can relates with applied Computer Science topics and
Music as well. As I can speak, using mathematics and computer engineering
techniques for synthesizing music would not be awesome?


## Why Ryukinix and Lerax nicknames?

Ryukinix it's come from 2009: my char's name of the game Ragnarok, private
server *Odin-br*. Was my archer char. I was thinking a good original
name... And that random name comes to my mind. No especial reason. By
the way, good time.

Lerax it's come from 2013: a random name that I choose for the
character of my WarFace account, a FPS game written on top of the
CryEngine.

Since these days, I've using the both nicknames on different situations.
