## Tag of life
Love Mathematics - then the subsequent science falls like a glove upon that passion. All knowledge is valid, but IT is the merger that captivates me more. 

## Programming Languages

In general I like programming mostly in Python, Commmon Lisp and C. Sometimes I try to code in Go or other languages.

## Actual life

Manoel M. Vilela Neto, is student in Computer Engineering since 2014 by the Federal University of Pará (UFPA) - Tucuruí, Pará, Brazil. It has interests in the area of computational intelligence and robotics. Currently, in addition graduation, he is participating in a project involving Core Routines on Operating System Unix-like with the advisor Alexandre Beletti.

## Why Ryukinix?

It's come from 2009: my char's name of the game Ragnarok, private server *Odin-br*. Was my archer char. I thinking a original name... And that random name comes to my mind. By the way, good time.
