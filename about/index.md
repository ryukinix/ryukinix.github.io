## Tag of life
Love Mathematics - then the subsequent science falls like a glove upon that passion. All knowledge is valid, but IT is the merger that captivates me more.

## Programming Languages

In general I like programming mostly in Python, Go and C. Sometimes I try to code in Common Lisp or other languages.

## Current life

Manoel Vilela Machado Neto is a student of Computer Engineering since 2014. Started on the Federal University of Pará (UFPA) and migrated to Federal University of Ceará (UFC) in 2016, which currently studies. It has interests in the area of computational intelligence and robotics.

## Why Ryukinix?

It's come from 2009: my char's name of the game Ragnarok, private server *Odin-br*. Was my archer char. I was thinking a good original name... And that random name comes to my mind. No especial reason. By the way, good time.
