## About Me
I have a deep passion for Mathematics and the sciences that build upon it. While I believe all knowledge is valuable, I'm most captivated by the intersection of mathematics and computer science. You can find my resume here: https://resume.lerax.me

## Programming Languages

I enjoy programming in several languages, with a preference for Python, Lisp, and C. I also have experience with Haskell, Rust, Go, and F#. While I'm familiar with C++, Java, and C#, I don't use them as frequently. Here's a self-assessment of my skills and interest in various languages:

## Current Life

Manoel Vilela Machado Neto has been a Computer Engineering student since 2014. He began his studies at the Federal University of Pará (UFPA) and transferred to the Federal University of Ceará (UFC) in 2016, where he is currently enrolled. His primary interests are in computational intelligence and operating systems. He has been focusing on Natural Language Processing since 2015 and has also developed a recent interest in Digital Signal Processing (2017).

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the connections between pure Mathematics, applied Computer Science, and Music. For example, I find the idea of using mathematical and computer engineering techniques to synthesize music to be fascinating.


## The Nicknames: Ryukinix and Lerax

**Ryukinix** comes from 2009; it was the name of my archer character in the Ragnarok private server *Odin-br*. I was looking for an original name, and it just came to me. No special reason, but those were good times.

**Lerax** comes from 2013; it was a random name I chose for my character in WarFace, an FPS game built on the CryEngine.

Since then, I've used both nicknames in different situations.
