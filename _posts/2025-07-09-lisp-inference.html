I've been working on this since 2017. The current web application version is
possible to access through <a href="https://logic.manoel.dev">logic.manoel.dev</a>. The main page looks like
this:

It's a application written in Common Lisp that is capable to generate
a truth table for logical expressions. The source can be found in my
github profile <a href="https://github.com/ryukinix/lisp-inference/">ryukinix/lisp-inference</a>. It contains as well a <b>share</b>
button so the users can share expressions with its truth table, some
known tautologies are provided as hyperlinks as well.

<h2 id="orgefee905">Prologue</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgefee905">
<p>
The initial system was designed to be a propositional calculus
checker, in the sense of:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org1427545">
Given a set of K premises, show how we can deduce this conclusion C.
</pre>

<p>
This was requested as an engineering task in my computer engineering
graduation in 2014, during the first period. Funny, what did the
professor think when requesting something like this for the students
in the first year? The outcome was not good, as anyone could probably
imagine. The project was designed to be split in such a way that part
of the classroom was doing X, Y, Z&#x2026; and in the end, the small parts
would be glued together to form a "Propositional Calculator."
</p>

<p>
Well, this professor talked about Lisp to us, but what everyone had
started to learn basically two months ago was programming in C. I'm
not sure, but he really tried to convince us that a header called
<code>&lt;lisp.h&gt;</code> was real and we could use it to process lists using C, using
functions like car and cdr.
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure if the professor was going crazy or if it was just a lie,
but this didn't exist. And most of the students were struggling to
just implement linked lists. The result was a complete disaster; most
of the groups, which were split from A to F, failed completely.
</p>

<p>
To this day, I think this impossible task was aimed at giving students
a real feeling about how hard engineering is, because some weeks
before this, the same professor was teaching us digital electronics,
and after other hard courses (like calculus and physics), someone
said, "Hey, this is easy." I think he took this personally, I'm not
sure. Besides this, he was a great professor teaching digital
electronics.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, since this failure, I had already read about Common Lisp
because of Serial Experiments Lain a year ago (2013). Then, my
interest in this increased even more because Lisp seemed like such an
ALIEN technology, which was fascinating to me.

<h2 id="org0c913b1">Common Lisp? Why?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0c913b1">
<p>
Well, most part of the literature I've found abouth proof checkers,
propositional logic and in the classic sense was written in
Lisp. Curiously, most part of the books the professor shared was
doctor thesis or really old books (from 197X).
</p>

<p>
To accomplish the initial task, that actually to see this happening, I
decided to learn Common Lisp properly. Between 2015-2016 I was only
looking superfially how Lisp works, how Emacs works&#x2026; But not having
much time to get into it. In 2017, however, I got a deep dive on it.
</p>

<p>
I started to read <i>Structured and Interpretation of Computer
Programmings</i> (SICP), watched all the youtube course of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Op3QLzMgSY&amp;list=PLE18841CABEA24090">MIT 6.001 of
1986</a> and read from start to end the book <a href="http://landoflisp.com/">Land of Lisp</a> (very fun to
read, btw). All my notes about this journey of learning is scattered
in some small code and notes in this repository called <a href="https://github.com/ryukinix/lisp-insights">lisp-insights</a>.
</p>

<p>
After thoroughly reading a lot about this and learning Common Lisp
more profoundly, I decided to apply my recently acquired
knowledge. The first project was actually <a href="https://lerax.me/programming/lisp-chat/">Lisp Chat</a>, a fun experience
of managing a chat using raw TCP sockets and being capable of using
even netcat as a client.
</p>

<p>
It's still 2017, three years since 2014, when my previous professor
showed the nightmare of dealing with propositional calculus. In that
year, I started lisp-inference and got some stuff working on
generating truth tables, although this was not exactly the initial
request.
</p>

<p>
To create a real logical proposition checker, I had to implement the
<a href="https://coursys.sfu.ca/2018sp-cmpt-384-d1/pages/Wang">Wang's Algorithm</a>, which was, at that moment, beyond my comprehension
of how I'd deal with it. I even tried to start, dealing with
expression transformation, like simplification, double negation,
equivalences, etc. An automation of human deduction of logical proofs.
</p>

<p>
Since then, I have worked on this project, improving it little by
little each year. It's almost my personal laboratory for Common Lisp.

I worked on revitilization of this application due being a important
project for me, even without any practical usage. Some things was
really important to deal with, including:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/ryukinix/lisp-inference/pull/31">implementing a pratt parser;</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ryukinix/lisp-inference/pull/35">implement a share button to share truth tables</a>;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ryukinix/lisp-inference/pull/33">change deprecated web framework weblocks to reblocks;</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ryukinix/lisp-inference/pull/30/files">restylize web application;</a></li>
<li>changed testing framework prove to rove;</li>

<li>error handling of invalid expressions;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ryukinix/lisp-inference/pull/42">reject expressions with more than 10 premisses</a>;</li>
