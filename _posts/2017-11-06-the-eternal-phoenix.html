This is a lot of introspection about all my life: in the nested deaths
and ressurections. Mainly about the depressing eras and fighting with
it. How is the sound of a mind like that? The album covers a random
composing music on these days. How can I say&#x2026; it's just about me.
</p>

<p>
For me, was always (and always will be) like a eternal phoenix cycle: death inside, reborn. <b>Repeat</b>.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to <i>Boa</i> and <i>Vivaldi</i> creating so much nice good music, the
<i>Mindblowing</i> and <i>Lost</i> tracks was covers of the respective musics
authors: Vivalid Tribute and Duvet.

<p>
As extra track, I added later of publish date a old cover that I
recorded of Cello Suit I Prelude in G of John Sebastian Bach, but
incomplete.
