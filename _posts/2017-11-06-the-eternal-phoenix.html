<p>
This is a lot of introspection about my entire life: the nested deaths
and resurrections. Mainly about the depressing eras and fighting with
it. How does the sound of a mind like that sound? The album covers a random
composing music on these days. How can I say... it's just about me.

<p>
For me, was always (and always will be) like a eternal phoenix cycle: dead inside, reborn. <b>Repeat</b>.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to <i>Boa</i> and <i>Vivaldi</i> creating so much awesome musics, the
<i>Mindblowing</i> and <i>Lost</i> tracks was covers of the respective music
authors: Vivaldi Tribute by Patrick Rondat and Duvet by <i>Boa</i>.
</p>

<p>
As extra track, I added later of publish date a old cover that I
recorded of <i>Cello Suit I Prelude in G</i> by <i>John Sebastian Bach</i>, but
the execution is just a sample (not completed).
