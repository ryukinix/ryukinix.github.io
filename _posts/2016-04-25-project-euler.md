## Main Proposal

The aim of the [organization](https://www.github.com/DestructHub) is to provide a collection of solutions to common and unusual challenges found in the programming world. Why? Because it's fun, it's useful for learning, and we can learn from other people! Currently, we are a small group, about one year old, with around 20 members.

We want as many polyglot programmers as possible. Currently, we have solutions in Python, C, C++, Go, Haskell, Elixir, Lua, Clojure, and Common Lisp!

You love math? We love it too! Currently, we have been focusing on [Project Euler](https://www.github.com/DestructHub/ProjectEuler) since its creation! We have almost 100 solutions (counting the alternative solutions on all programming languages)!

Join us and enter the sea of destruction!
