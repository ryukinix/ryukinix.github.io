[![PyPi version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mal.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mal/)

## Description

[`mal`](https://github.com/ryukinix/mal) is a command-line client for [MyAnimeList.net](http://myanimelist.net/). It uses their official [API](http://myanimelist.net/modules.php?go=api), so it should remain functional indefinitely (unlike screen-scraping alternatives). But is in alpha development yet, so new ideas is welcome! This version is a inspired tool from the slow-maintained [mal](https://github.com/pushrax/mal).

Actually I get partial of your code to start (most for now is called as api.py inside the my MAL).

## Reason

Because CLI is life and open the browser is boring. I'm implemented the most code in half-day, but the worse part was doing Packaging & Distrubution for Python. `setuptools + pypi == hell`. But now I'm okay with this and appears works very fine.
