## The life for now


    The life passing so fast, but sometimes, so slow. All the days is the same thing.

![loop-infinite](https://68.media.tumblr.com/d5a7e8ff619286fd89ab267cd198dc00/tumblr_n4no77cKRl1qby49yo1_500.gif)

I'm really tired. So tired that I really could sleep for a month and nothing would change. Wake up. ~~Suffering~~ Code something. Sleep.

In the last two days, I have been watching an anime called [`Welcome to the NHK`](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1210/NHK_ni_Youkoso). It tell a history about a schizophrenic guy with 22 years old (my actual age) with extremely social anxiety and your ~~mis~~ adventures with the life. **Why all sucks so hard?** Because the society rejection and the depression of itself , Satou (the main character) after your first period at Tokyo University he turned a Hikikomori  — a person whose live isolated in your room and recuse with all efforts to go out of your home — and he are living that way for the last three years.

The anime talk about themes like social isolation, hikikomori, otaku, depression, suicide, drugs, games and programming (in some moment). Is a heavy mixture of reality, [**sadness**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ei2izPLpHc) and [**comedy**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkz6504BKng). Actually, is a really a wonderful adventure and the anime is really funny in general. However, if you have a similar life of Satou, can be really painful sometimes. Or can be your savior too. Anyway, worthwhile watching `Welcome to NHK`.

## Afinities with `Welcome to the NHK`

But... In determined moment during the adventure of watching this... I really have it feel it that Satou, actually, is a mirror of myself.The similarities did keep since the first episode until the end. I really had a deep comprehension of Satou's feelings. And this is really bad.

During the debugging of my jobs or my other painfull software activities, I have a deep feel to break all. Really this, with a hammer. But I cannot.
I'm living yet because of my computer.

The biggest afinity was when Satou said that sequence of phrases:

![satou-give-up](http://pa1.narvii.com/5879/e31f7967b63740c1a4a590c3475f03c545d11be2_hq.gif)

- I don't want to meet anyone
- I don't want to answer my cell phone (mainly it)
- I don't want to do anything
- I don't even want to live
- But dying's such a hassle.

Always when Satou had a psychotic break he blamed that is a conspiracy behind of your life fucking all.


    So I'll say now: `IT'S ALL A CONSPIRACY!`.

## The end


    The biggest question whose comes to us sometime in a long sequence of conspiracy
