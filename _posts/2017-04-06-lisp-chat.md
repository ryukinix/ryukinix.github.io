## Description

I did this as an exercise after reading the entire Land of Lisp book. On the other hand, I did it because I was too bored â€” I don't know if this matters. But, anyway, it's just another minimal, simple chat over TCP sockets without any smart, solid protocol (like IRC). It's just raw data from client-to-server, and the server broadcasts the message to all connected clients.

The whole idea is very simple. The software is separated into `client.lisp` and `server.lisp`. While `server.lisp` is running, it listens for connections from a specified port (example: 5558) for the clients. On the other hand, `client.lisp`, well... connects to the server and lets the user send messages to it. All messages sent to `server.lisp`, when received, are broadcast by the server to all connected clients. It's just like an IRC with a single room.

It seems very stupid, I know, but actually, because the implementation is so simple, we can assign a certain value to this. BTW, this post was my first front-page on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13857880) with 114 points. I really didn't expect something like that when I wrote it. So, well, this seems to have some beauty. Maybe the reason is: software
written in Lisp? (HAHAHA)

The system, both client and server, is implemented using SBCL (Common Lisp
Compiler) and USOCKET (TCP/UDP sockets). Just that. Cool, huh?



## Showcase

Yes. Only me. Actually, on the HN trending day, some people cloned the
project, set it up, and ran it. I just saw the log later. HAHAH Some guys were typing things like `(quit)` or `ls`. Very funny. Actually, the server supports three undocumented commands: `/users`, `/help`, and `/log`. But don't tell it to anyone.

P.S.: Yes, after `22:29:16`, I typed `/log`, and old messages came back.



## Source
You can look to the source here on
[github](https://github.com/ryukinix/lisp-chat) The minimal
instructions to build and setup the project is written on
README.md. At least for now, the day I wrote this post a server
instance is running at `server.lerax.me:5558`. As alternative I
provide too, for non-lispers, a simple Python client too. Both clients
and the servers are configured to running at `server.lerax.me:5558`.
