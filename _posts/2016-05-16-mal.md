[![PyPi version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mal.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mal/)

## Description

[`mal`](https://github.com/ryukinix/mal) is a command-line client for [MyAnimeList.net](http://myanimelist.net/). It uses their official [API](http://myanimelist.net/modules.php?go=api), so it should remain functional indefinitely (unlike screen-scraping alternatives). But it is in alpha development yet, so new ideas are welcome! This version is a inspired tool from the slow-maintained [mal](https://github.com/pushrax/mal).

I actually used part of its code to get started (most of it is currently in `api.py` within my MAL project).

## Reason

Because the CLI is life and opening the browser is boring. I implemented most of the code in half a day, but the worst part was handling Packaging & Distribution for Python. `setuptools + pypi == hell`. But now I'm okay with this, and it appears to work very well.
